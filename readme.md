# Rubric
*Homework/classwork will be graded on four criteria:*
- Understandability/Cleanliness
  - We will write code that works. But creating code that is elegant takes more work.
- Integration of lessons
  - Course content will be presented. The most important lesson is going to be the lessons you teach yourself through troubleshooting.
- Timeliness
  - Turning assignments in on time is essential to gauge progress.
- Creativity
  - I want you to iterate over your code and projects. For example, when you think you're done step back and look at your code and see if it is the most readable or if you could do it better. Also planning how you're going to write your code helps.

## Below is an example of a grading rubric for an activity where the exercise prompt is to demonstrate knowledge of variables.

#### Example of a helpful project submission
| Criteria | Example |
| :--: | -- |
| *Understandability/Cleanliness* | Code is well spaced (Some may say beautifyied). Variables are named descriptively. Comments describe architecture and basic construction of assignment. |
| *Integration of Lessons* | Different data types are saved in variables. Variables are assigned to each other, in a cohesive manner. There may be even some outside research in the final product. |
| *Timeliness* | Project was done with time to spare so that instructor can review and give feedback at time of submission. |
| *Creativity* | Variables show intention and build to a more meta concept than solely addressing the base requirements. |

### *Example of a project Failure.*

| Criteria | Example |
| :--: | -- |
| *Understandability/Cleanliness* | Single letter variable names. |
| *Integration of Lessons* | Project shows a direct copy paste from lecture with no context or ideas. |
| *Timeliness* | Project was submitted late. |
| *Creativity* | Variables do not show relationship to one another or any type of complexity. Does not exceed base requirement demonstratign a narrow understanding of concepts and lacks contextual applicability. |
